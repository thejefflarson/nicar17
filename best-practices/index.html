  <body>
    <div>When dealing with data, strive to make it so one command kicks off all
      analysis and cleaning.
    </div>
    <div>That command should delete and recreate any database you have from scratch
      Keep the data you've collected -- via FOIA, websites, or other sources -- it it's original form, never ever change it
    </div>
    <div>Go row by row when importing and cleaning, but analyze the data in dataframes or tables.
    </div>
    <div>You have a super computer. Process your data in parallel.
    </div>
    <div>Use multiple processes when dealing with disk cpu bound tasks and multiple threads when dealing with network requests.
    </div>
    <div>Learn to think asynchronously.
    </div>
    <div>Treat data and behavior as seperate -- when you create an object strive to keep the data immutable.
    </div>
    <div>Strive to minimize side effects or global state, when called with the same data a function should always return the same thing.
    </div>
    <div>Stay Organized, always be cleaning up after yourself.
    </div>
    <div>Use version control.
    </div>
    <div>Never comment out code. Delete it.
    </div>
    <div>Use an editor that you can change by programming.
    </div>
    <div>Learn the defaults of your computing environment before you customize.
    </div>
    <div>Rely on mixins over inheritance.
    </div>
    <div>Prefer events to function calls for interactives.
    </div>
    <div>Write tests for some things.
    </div>
    <div>Use libraries and frameworks
    </div>
    <div>Don't use libraries or frameworks.
    </div>
    <div>Read other people's code.
    </div>
    <div>Take one project a year and write it in another language.
    </div>
    <div>Deploy using containers.
    </div>
    <div>Less code is better code.
    </div>
